# Text-Field Validation App

A landing page showing an authentication screen with the option to either signup or signin. The main purpose and functionality of this app is to apply validations on text fields and on form submissions. 
  - The auth screen applies the concepts of validating input depending on the required text field. 
  - The next screen has a credit card validation form which applies the same concept, in addition to the form submission validation.
  - Only when the card validation is completed, the user can land on the home welcome screen.
